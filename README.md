# Game #01
Hello Everyone,  
Please **DO NOT** share anything in this repository. The game is a **Top Down Shooter**.    

This group is meant to not share any files in the repository unless allowed by the project's manager.    

# Group
**Group Managers:** PikzelBoy, David  
**Developers:** Destroyer_135, Unistructured  

# How This Works
You will have a branch dedicated for your work, when you want to commit your work to the master you will have to create a merge request and all the Group Managers will look at what you have made to authorize it to go on the master repository. If the master repository is changed you will be notified and told to update your work. The unity collab feature will **not** be used.

# QNA
**What if I need to go back to an older file?**  
You would look at the recent commits for your branch and find the file that you need to roll back to. Then you either download the files or change your current files    

**Can I change scripts like the character controller?**  
Only if its an explained bug.    

**Can I change any files if I find a bug?**  
No, you cannot change any files that are not part of the task that you have been assigned.  

**What if somebody changes a file that they shouldnâ€™t have changed?**  
You would check the issues section of the repository and check if anyone files a bug report against that file and for access too change it. If they changed it without any issues or bug reports you would make an issue on that on the issues section and if allowed to roll back, you would roll back.    

**How do I report a bug?**  
You open up the Issues section and make an issue.  

**Who looks at the Issues?**  
Everyone in the team can view them and reply to them but only the Group Managers can accept or decline the issue.    

**In what occasions can I change README.md?**  
You can only change README.md to edit the todo list or fix any spelling mistakes.    

**What am I assigned to do?**  
You will be sent a message on discord and your name will be posted beside the task in the todo list.  

**What is gitlab?**  
Gitlab is what we use for our private repository. If you do not know what it is, this is a free alternative to Github. But what is Github? That is explained on this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E
